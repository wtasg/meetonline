## Git Branching

- Use feature branches for bigger tasks/stories.
    - feature_fe/fe for frontend

    - feature_db/db for database
    - branch name should contain underscores (instead of slashes)
- Use task_issuenumber for smaller tasks or PR.
- Main branch
    - Do not use main to push code.
    - Use main branch only to pull --rebase code.
- rebase instead of merging locally.

## Merging and commit credit

- Merge PRs with only one commit (squash locally or in PRs)
    - Merge with Squash if commits are low quality
    - Merge with commits if commits are good quality
    - Keep track of credit. Do not hide or overtake someone else's work. Make sure that each contributor get at least one commit.
